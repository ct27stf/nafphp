Not A Framework written in PHP
==============================

Why would you like to create your own framework?
------------------------------------------------

* To learn more about the low level architecture of modern web frameworks in general.

* To create a framework tailored to your very specific needs (just be sure first that your needs are really specific);

* To experiment creating a framework for fun (in a learn-and-throw-away approach);

* To refactor an old/existing application that needs a good dose of recent web development best practices;

* To prove the world that you can actually create a framework on your own (... but with little effort).
